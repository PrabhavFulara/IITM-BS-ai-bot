BS in Data Science & Applications -  from IIT Madras

___________________________________________________

A)   Data Science & Applications
IIT Madras has launched the BS in Data Science and Applications. In this program, the course contents are delivered online and can be studied by anyone from anywhere, while the monthly quizzes and final semester exams will have to be attended in-person at designated centres.


Depending on the number of courses completed, learners can earn

a Foundation level certificate
Diploma in Programming/Diploma in Data Science or both
BSc degree in Programming and Data Science
BS degree in Data Science and Applications
1.    Highlights of the programme
Courses are taught by faculty of IIT Madras/other reputed institutes as well as experts from the industry.

Unlike many competitive admission exams which work on the philosophy of elimination and selection and admit a very limited number of learners into various programmes based on their performance relative to that of others, in this programme there are specific qualifying criteria,  and a significantly large number of learners can enter.

Learners of any background, be it engineering, sciences, humanities, arts, medicine, law, etc can attempt and join this programme.

There is no limitation on the age of the learner or their geographical location.

2.    Flexibility
There are two entry and four exit points, with learners being able to exit with either course certificates, or diploma or the degree. Learners can choose their pace of study every term. Being an online programme, there is no geographical barrier to learning from this programme - learners only need to travel to exam centres for exams each term.


IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: This programme is NOT BASED on an admission process.  Qualified learners can attempt respective stages of the programme and those who clear each stage will receive the certificate corresponding to that stage alone.


So, for example, the learner should be aware that they are not being admitted to a degree programme after the Qualifier. It is only for the set of Foundation courses, which on successful completion makes them eligible to enter the Diploma level. The diplomas or degrees are obtained by the candidate only when the requisite number of credits are accrued by completing the courses prescribed and satisfying any other mandatory criteria.


Admission to any level does not automatically entitle the learner to exit the programme with the Diploma or the degree.

3.    Courses in the programme
3.1 Definition of credit in the program
The credits here are based on the UGC system of counting 14 hours of learner engagement as 1 credit. (1 credit mentioned here would be equivalent to 3 credits in the current IITM campus Credit system.)

The fees paid to attempt the Qualifier exam will not be refunded in either of the two situations  - for those who missed writing the qualifier exam and for those who did not pass it.

5.1.7 Second attempt: If a candidate was absent or failed the first attempt of qualifier exam
There are two attempts within any term currently. In every term, qualifier exams are conducted at the end of 4 weeks and at the end of 8 weeks.

Eligibility to apply for Reattempting Qualifier exam within the same term:

A learner who became eligible for the hall ticket in the qualifier process of a term but was absent for the final exam
failed in the first attempt
Such candidates do not have to repeat the assignments as they have already become eligible.

This re-attempt application form will open up immediately after the qualifier results are announced. The fee for this is as follows:

General Category / OBC Applicant

₹1500 re-attempt fee

SC / ST Category / PwD (>= 40% disability ) Applicant

₹750 re-attempt fee

SC / ST Category Applicant who is ALSO PwD (>= 40% disability )

₹375 re-attempt fee


5.1.8 Candidates who did not become eligible for Qualifier exam
There are no limits on the number of times a candidate can attempt the qualifier process.

The candidate can attempt again the subsequent terms.

They have to pay the full fees as per the fee norms applicable for their category. (and additional exam facilitation fee in case of candidates outside India)

This will be considered like a fresh application and they have to redo the 4 weeks of course work and weekly graded assignments and become eligible to get the hall ticket for the qualifier exam

5.1.9 Options to register to courses once qualified
Candidates who qualify in the first attempt within a term
have the option to register to courses and continue with completing them in the same term. In this case, qualifier score is treated as Quiz1 score to calculate the Final score.
Have the option to register to courses in the next 2 terms till when the qualifier score is valid.
Candidates who qualify in the second attempt within a term can ONLY register from the subsequent term till the qualifier score is valid.

In a learner's first term immediately following the qualifier exam, the qualifier exam scores and assignment scores in the subjects registered will be considered as Quiz 1 score and first 4 assignment scores of the corresponding subjects.

5.2 JEE-based Entry into Foundation Level
There is a direct entry into the Foundation level of the program for students who have qualified for the JEE Advanced Exams. Currently the validity of this is for the 3 terms following the release of the JEE Advanced Eligibility list.


Candidates who qualified to appear for JEE Advanced 2022 can directly join our program in the Sep 2023/Jan 2024 Term and Candidates who qualified to appear for JEE Advanced 2023 can directly join our program in the Sep 2023/Jan 2024/May 2024/Sep 2024/Jan 2025 Terms


The process will be as follows:


Apply to the Qualifier process, saying Yes to the question on eligibility to JEE Advanced level. Upload a valid proof for the same.

If the proof is found to be valid:
The candidate will be declared eligible to join the Foundational level courses.
They will be issued the admission letter.
Such candidates can directly register to courses in the foundation level with CCC as 4.


If the proof document submitted is found to be not valid, the student will be moved into the category of non-JEE and will be treated as a regular entry candidate to the foundation level and have to go through the qualifier process.
6.   Credit Clearing Capability
The value S used to determine the maximum number of courses that the learner is permitted to register in a term is calculated as shown below.

Term 1: decided by qualifier marks
Term 2: decided by average of marks of all courses taken in Term 1 in which the learner has passed
Term n (n>2): M = average marks of courses passed in the previous two terms Term n-1 and Term n-2  (This will be calculated using marks of subjects in which the candidate has passed, not those which he/she has not passed or is not completed yet); (n-1 and n-2 terms must be terms where the learner status is Active - defined in section 11.  Learner Life Cycle

Marks M (as defined above)

Maximum number of courses that learner is permitted to register in any term

0 <= M< 50

2

50 <= M< 70

3

 M >= 70

4


The credit clearing capability CCC will be decided as follows:

If a learner has passed at least one course in term n-1, then the CCC of term n will be calculated based on the marks as given in the above table.
If a learner has failed all courses the learner has appeared for in term n-1, CCC of next term n will be 2.
If a learner is absent for final exam of all courses, thus not completing their courses and not getting grades, CCC of next term = CCC of the learner's last term

CCC is kept as 4 by default for

everyone who chooses to register to courses in the same term as the qualifier exam
For all JEE candidates in the first term
For everyone in the Diploma and Degree levels
7.   Course registration - steps involved
Students who are continuing with the program will go through the following steps to sign up for the courses:

Within the registration window, students will pick the courses they want to take in the coming term, with limiting criteria on total courses registered being their CCC i.e learners can register to maximum number of courses <= their CCC.
Students pick 2 cities among the choices provided for their quizzes and exams for that term.
They have the freedom to choose a different set of cities than the ones they opted for in the previous terms.
Also they can choose a different set of cities for every quiz/final exam while registering for the courses so that accordingly booking may be done with the Exam vendor for slots in these cities.
Students can register to courses for which the prerequisite is completed. The pre-requisites are mentioned in 13.9 Prerequisite course requirements
e.g. in order to sign up for Math-2, the learner must have cleared Math-1
Students can take any course within a particular level of study but are not allowed to sign up for courses across levels.
Students who successfully complete all courses in the Foundation level will be eligible for admission to the Diploma level program.
Learners who successfully complete all courses in the Foundation and diploma programme will be eligible for admission to the degree level, if they satisfy the prescribed/regulatory criteria.
Students who complete 114 credits as per the norms will be eligible for the BSc degree and can continue onto the BS level.
Learners pay only for the number of credits they are signing up for (online payment only).
8.   Direct Entry into Diploma programme
For those who have the foundations to enter the Diploma programme directly and those who wish to do just the Diploma and exit with it, this is a pathway. It is primarily aimed at working professionals or learners who already possess the fundamentals taught in Year 1 of this programme to enter the Diploma level directly.


Entry - Into Diploma level

Exit - One or both Diplomas from IIT Madras 

8.1  Eligibility to Apply
Students who have completed 2 years in any UG degree programme are permitted to apply to the diploma level through direct entry. Their second year marksheet or higher must be submitted as proof to qualify under this category.

8.2 Qualifying Process
A separate Direct Admission to Diploma (DAD) qualifier exam will be conducted for the Diploma in programming (DP) and Diploma in Data Science (DS).
These are conducted on the same date as the end term examinations of the IITM BS DS program. Hence these are conducted three times a year.
Any candidate crossing the cut off marks defined below will be eligible to enter the Diploma Programme corresponding to the qualifier attempted and register to the courses.
There will be no limit on the number of attempts by any candidate for direct entry, though the recommendation would be that if they do not pass the qualifier, they attempt through the foundation level.
The qualifier for DAD-DP will be a 3 hr exam, subjects being English, Aptitude and 6 weeks of Maths 1. Students have to study Computational Thinking, Introduction to Python and then move on to the Programming Diploma subjects.
The qualifier exam for the DAD-DS will be a 4 hr exam, with subjects being English, Maths 1, Statistics 1 and Python programming. Students have to start with Maths 2 and Statistics 2 and then continue with subjects in the Data Science diploma.

Students who have completed the Diploma in Data Science by Direct admission are directly eligible to also pursue the Diploma in Programming, if they wish to, without attempting the qualifier exam for this.

But students who complete the Diploma in Programming and wish to pursue the Diploma in Data Science have to appear for the qualifier for DS as they would not have studied Statistics 1 and Maths 1 as part of course work.

9. Credit Transfer
Credit Transfer for NPTEL Courses
The following process is to be followed for credit transfer from NPTEL:

An NPTEL course of duration 4/8/12 weeks carries credit equivalence of 1/2/3 credits in the BS degree program.
The learner must  register for the NPTEL exam using the @ds.study.iitm.ac.in Email ID.
The learner has to register for NPTEL exams, pay the exam fee, and complete the NPTEL course.
An NPTEL course can be transferred for credit only once and only to one program. The learner has to give an undertaking that they are submitting this course for credit transfer only to the IITM BS Degree program.
The NPTEL courses will be added in PASS/FAIL mode and counted towards the credits with no letter grade and will not be included in the CGPA calculation.
The fee for credit transfer from NPTEL courses is fixed as Rs 1000/- per credit. Hence, Rs 1000/-, Rs 2000/-, Rs 3000/- should be remitted as fees if a learner opts for credit transfer from NPTEL courses of duration 4/8/12 weeks. This fee is to be paid to the BS degree program, and is separate from the fee to be paid to NPTEL to complete the course.
The learner can complete NPTEL courses any time after joining the Foundation Level (using the official IITM email) and apply for the course credit transfer in the BSc/BS levels.
Refer the below table to know which term NPTEL courses can be transferred to which term in BS
Students are required to pay the RKA fee if they are only doing a credit transfer in a term.

Credit Transfer from courses that are conducted on IITM campus (**This will be in effect from January 2024**)
A maximum of 24 credits can be earned from any campus courses.
24 Graded [from on campus courses of IITM], 24 non graded credits allowed [apprenticeship, other institute, NPTEL]. MS (approve / reject) 28 credits  [Theory (16 credits) + Apprenticeship (12 credits) ] allowed. 3 campus credits (from IITM) = 1 BS credit.
Students who have completed the foundation and the 2 diplomas and have cgpa of >=8 will be eligible to earn credits from campus courses.
The maximum number of credits that can be taken at the BSc level will be 8. These credits are to be obtained from the Engineering, Science or Management departments.
Students who have completed 114 credits in the IITM BS program and completed the BSc level with a cgpa of >=8 will be permitted to credit 24-x credits at the BS level where x is the number of credits they have earned in the BSc level from IITM campus courses. A maximum of 8 credits can be transferred from the HS category in the BS level, including the HS category credits earned through NPTEL.
 IITM BS students can apply to courses they are interested in and their acceptance will be based on the availability of seats for the course.
The fees for transferring the credits from each on-campus course will be Rs 2500/- per credit of IITM BS program. The fee to be paid to the institute will be apart from this and will be as per the institute norms.
Students will have to attend the class in person unless a hybrid mode of accessing the classes is available. The on-campus courses credited by the BS students will be listed in the transcript along with the corresponding grades. The credits transferred from the on-campus courses into the BS program will be counted towards the CGPA of the student.

Applicable for the student who completed 142 credits:

Once a student completes 142 credits in term X and has not started any CGPA or credit-earning courses in or before Term X, they will not be permitted to register any further in the program and their BS degree certificate will be processed.

Case 2: If a student completes 142 credits in Term X and has started any CGPA or credit-earning courses in or before Term X, they will have two options:


Case 2a: If the student chooses to complete the BS in term X and receive the certificate, the CGPA or credit-earning courses will not be listed on the BS transcript.

Case 2b: If the student opts to receive the BS certificate only when the additional components such as apprenticeship or other campus courses are completed, then the BS transcript will include the credits for these also and the BS certificate will be generated after this.

Note: IITM Campus Courses are counted towards CGPA while apprenticeships and on-campus courses from other institutes are counted only for credits and not CGPA.

.

Upgradation from Online BS in Data Science and Applications to MS by research in Data Science  & Artificial Intelligence

Students with a CGPA≥8.0, upon completion of core courses at the degree level of the BS program(at least 106 credits)shall be eligible to apply for the opportunity to complete their remaining credits at the Department of DSAI,IIT Madras and continue for an MS 9by research)degree.
The BS program team will collate the applications and share the list of eligible candidates with the Department of DSAI.
The Department of DSAI will screen the applications(using a written test,interview,or both) and shortlisted qualified candidates for this program.
Selected candidates can complete the BS level (28 credits)by taking courses  and completing an 8-month  research  project (counted  under the  12-credit  apprenticeship) at  the  Department  of  DSAl,IIT  Madras.
Students who complete the BS level credits with a CGPA≥8.0 from campus courses/projects shall continue for the MS(by research)degrees at the Department of DSAl,IIT  Madras.
Students who complete the BS level credits with a CGPA <8.0 from campus courses/projects shall not be upgraded to the MS(by research)degree. The credits earned shall be transferred back to the BS program. Such students may apply for the MS(by research)program by clearing the GATE exam.
10.  Learner Life Cycle
Once a learner clears the qualifier, he/she will be eligible to register for the Foundation level. Using their personal email id, they register to as many courses as permitted by CCC and make the payment. After approval of the uploaded documents, the learner is given a roll_number@ds.study.iitm.ac.in email id.


Henceforth all interactions on the portal right from login to accessing the learner dashboard and courses will be via this email id.


There will be 5 statuses for any learner in the programme : On the rolls/Active, On Academic Probation, Struck off the rolls, Alumnus, Quit the programme

On the rolls/Active - When a learner is registered in any term for one or more courses after paying the course fees, the status will be "On the rolls" or Active.
On academic probation/Not registering to any course in a term:
After joining the programme, a learner may skip up to 2 terms consecutively without taking any courses. In the two terms where the learner does not register for any course, the learner status will be marked as "On Academic Probation". The learner email ID will still be kept alive while the learner is on academic probation.

The learner can actively inform us about not registering to courses by paying the "Registration keep alive fee (RKA)" of Rs 1000/- per term. In case of registering to courses in the next term, the learners have to only pay the course fees.
The learner may not pay the RKA and have it as pending to be paid. Pending RKA will include 10% extra over regular RKA when re-registering back.
To register to courses in the next term if not paid the RKA: The learner will have to pay the pending dues = (which will be Rs 1100/- or Rs 2200/- (Rs 1000 RKA +10% as penalty for each term where no courses are registered). The learner has to select the courses and pay the course fees. Once they do this, the learner status is changed to "On the rolls".
Struck off the rolls: If a learner with status "On Academic Probation" for 2 consecutive terms does not register for courses in the next term too, the learner's status is changed to "Struck off the rolls". The official email id is suspended.
Once struck off the rolls, to reactivate the registration, they will have to apply through a separate process as defined:
If the RKA for the previous 3 terms has already been paid, they have to request for reactivating the email id on payment of Re-admission fee of Rs 2500/-. Once done, they can register for the courses in the upcoming term.
If the RKA for the previous 3 terms has not been paid, the learner has to apply to activate his/her account by paying the pending dues which will be Rs 5800/- = Rs 2500 (Readmission fee) + Rs 3300/- (Rs 1000 RKA x 3terms+Rs 300 (10% as penalty)). On receipt of the payment, the official email id is activated again and they are permitted to register using this id. Once they do this, the status is changed to "On the rolls".
Any learner who is struck off the rolls 2 times, is removed from the programme.
Quitting the programme: There will also be an option inside the candidate dashboard which says "I quit the programme". Once the learner applies for this midway through a level, we suspend the official email account and activate the personal email account to access the dashboard. No reactivation for continuing the program is possible.
Alumnus: Learners who complete the BSc level / BS level and quit the program, at the end of it, we again suspend the official email id and activate the personal email account to access the dashboard. Their status will be changed to "Alumnus".

Students completing the foundation or diploma level and quitting the programme will have status as "FL certified" and "DS certified"/"DP certified"/"Both diplomas certified" but will not be awarded the Alumnus status.








11. Timeline for original certificate:
We need to get the senate approval before generating the original certificate. Senate meetings will be conducted three or four times in a year. Please refer the below timeline for certificate issue date

Note: Students who have completed the bsc and bs degree and wish to take their original certificate have to mandatorily register with the IITM alumni association, pay the fees of Rs 6000/- and confirm to the BS team. Only after this will the original certificate be processed.

15.7 Repeating a course
For improvement
A learner can repeat a course for improvement in grades any number of times. The fee for repeating the course for improvement will be twice the regular course fee and the learner will have to submit all the weekly assignments, appear for the quizzes and final exams. The highest score amongst all attempts for a course will be used for calculating the CGPA. 

If learner was not eligible to attempt the end term exam (grade=WA/WQ) or if the learner did not pass the course (Grade = U) 
If average assignment score < 40/100 or no quiz attended or T<40/100, the learner has to repeat the entire course. This includes submission of assignments and redoing all the subsequent quizzes and the end term exam. Fees for repeating the course is the same as the course fees.

If the learner was absent for the final exam alone (grade = I): The learner has 2 options:
Reappear for the final term exam - Makeup exam: They can attend only the end term exam whenever it is conducted in the subsequent term.
The fee to repeat an end term exam will be Rs.1000 for each course of the foundational level and Rs. 2000 for each course of the diploma / degree levels. 
If the learner reattempts the course in the immediate next term, then the average Quiz Score Q will be carried over and the learner does not have to resubmit the quizzes or the assignments.
If the learner wishes to skip the immediate next term and attempt the course in subsequent terms, then the entire course will have to be repeated including the weekly assignments and quizzes. 
A learner can reappear for the makeup exam  only once. If the learner misses the makeup exam, then the learner has to repeat the entire course in the term thereafter, by paying the full course fees and repeating all assignments, invigilated quizzes and the end term exam.
Repeat the entire course: They can choose to repeat the entire course. 
The fee to repeat the course will be the same as the regular course fees.
The learner must complete all assignments, invigilated quizzes and the end term exam.
Registering to this course will be counted as one of the courses permitted as per the CCC of the learner.

Note: Learners repeating a course for any reason must do so within the time and term limits:

Each level must be completed within 36 months (3 years / 9 terms).
The entire programme must be completed within 96 months (8 years / 24 terms).
15.7.1 Registering for Courses: Term 2 Onwards
Maximum number of final exams (full course+makeup exams) <= 4
Maximum number of new + repeat full course (if failed/absent if reqd/improvement) <= CCC
Registering for new courses is subject to fulfilment of all rules and prerequisites.
If a student passes all/some courses then CCC is calculated on the average of passed courses.
If a student fails all courses, then CCC is set to 2.
If a student is absent for all courses then CCC of the previous term is carried forward.
Make up exam will be permitted as an option only once in the subsequent term.
15.7.2 Repeating a Course - WA, WQ, U or I grade
Applicable for courses with WA, WQ, U or I grade.

You can choose to repeat courses in a single term or across multiple terms. You can also register for new courses in the term. The total number of courses must be within the CCC limit. Learners with an Incomplete (I) grade in a course can take a Make Up Exam instead of repeating the course.

15.7.3 Repeating a Course for Improvement
Applicable for courses with A, B, C, D or E grade.

You can choose to repeat courses to improve the grade in the course. The highest grade will be recorded in the transcript. The total number of courses must be within the CCC limit. Course fee Repeat for Improvement courses will be double the normal fee. Improvement courses can be registered at any level. Eg: Foundation course improvement can be registered at diploma level.  

Note: It is recommended that learners try and progress with new courses instead of repeating courses for improvement, unless a learner deems it absolutely necessary or needs to improve their learning of a course. All course material of completed courses are available to the learner throughout the course.  

15.7.4 Make Up Exams
Applicable for courses with I grade.

You can choose to take a Makeup Exam for a course with Incomplete (I) grade. Learners will only be required to reappear for the Final Exam for that course. The Makeup Exam does not count towards CCC, but a student can appear for a maximum of FOUR final exams in a term. If you have already registered for 4 courses, you do not have any more final exam slots available.


Note: The grading pattern for make-up exams will be as follows: the pattern used will be as per the formula used in the term the course work was done and not as per the term the makeup exam was taken.

15.8 Dropping a course (This is not applicable for the students who are continuing after qualifier in the same term)
Once the registration window closes in any term, adding courses will not be allowed. Dropping a course will be allowed within 4 weeks of the term start date and not beyond. Rs 2000 will be deducted if a Foundation level course is dropped and Rs 4000 will be deducted if a Diploma/Degree level course is dropped.

If the learner decides to drop out of the programme completely using the "I quit the programme" option, the course fee paid minus the deduction will be refunded to the learner and the learner will be removed from the programme, cancelling his official email id access. The status will also be changed to "Quit the programme".
If the learner drops one/a few of the courses registered to in a term, the refund will be made as given in the table below but the email id will be kept active so that he/she can continue with other ongoing courses and the programme. Status will be "Active".
If the learner opts to drop all courses registered in a  term, the refund will be done as per the table given below and the email id will be kept active so that the learner can come in and register in the next term. But this will be counted as a term with 0 courses. Status will be changed to "Academic probation".
The fee receipt will be generated post these 4 weeks after term start when drop is permitted so that all the courses and fees are tallied and confirmed.
Learners writing exams outside India would have paid Exam facilitation Fee while registering for the courses. For such learners:
If they drop from all courses in a term, 100% of the facilitation fee for Quiz 1 will be retained while 50% of the facilitation fee for quizzes 2 and final exam will be refunded.

Without completing all the 8 Foundation courses and the 12 Diploma level courses + 4 project courses, one cannot proceed to register for Year 3 Degree level courses.


Degree Level Courses:



Please note that L5_Degree courses are complex compared to Degree and L4_Degree courses. Course fee and credits are same as L4_Degree courses.


17. Changes in project grading (wef now) and Eligibility to enter the BSc Level (wef May 2024)
Here are two changes being effected with respect to project grading and eligibility to enter the degree level.

1. Project grading:

So far - students had to complete all feature requirements given for a project, pass the L1 viva and move onto the L2 viva and pass that too to get a pass grade.

Looking into the data we have, we understand that all students may not be equally proficient in the areas of programming, machine learning and business and excel in all 4 projects.

Hence the grading is being changed as follows:

MAD1, MAD2, MLP projects: WEF current term

For MAD1 and MAD2 projects, when the submitted Application passes the check for Appdev, L1 viva will be scheduled.
For MLP project, if the cutoff is crossed in the Kaggle contest and the student declares that all the models have been completed, the L1 viva is scheduled.

There are 2 cutoff marks that will be decided for the L1 level for each term:
Cutoff1: X, Cutoff2: Y;
X<Y, X>0
The L1 viva will be conducted and scoring will be done based on the rubrics defined for it. Based on the marks scored in L1 viva (L1_S), the following are the possibilities:
If (L1_S < X): Student has to resubmit the project. A few days are given for them to resubmit in the same term. If the second time also, L1_S<X, they will have to redo the project in the next term.
If (X <= L1_S < Y), then students are asked some additional questions for assessing their knowledge and awarded D or E grade. Such students do not go in for L2 viva at all. They will have a pass grade.
If (L1_S >= Y), L2 viva is scheduled for them.
If they pass the viva cutoff for L2, they get a grade including L1 and L2 scores.
If they do not pass the L2 viva cutoff, they get one more chance at L2 viva.
If they do not pass in the second attempt at L2 viva, they get an appropriate grade ( D or E) based on their L1 performance alone.
BDM project evaluation

So far: The process has been identifying the business, collecting data, analysing and sharing their insights.

Going forward from Jan 2024:

Students will be allowed to web scrape data and analyse it, sharing the source from where the data was taken. The BDM team will outline the steps involved.The maximum grade that the student can earn in this case will be D.


Eligibility for entering degree level of the program: WEF May 2024


For a student to progress to the degree level (BSc) of the Data Science and Applications program:
they must secure a CGPA of 6.0 or higher at the end of two diplomas (includes the courses in the foundation level and the diploma level and the projects)
AND a CGPA of 7.0 or higher in all the projects completed at the diploma level.
These CGPA requirements are not applicable to students who exit the program with the diploma(s).
Such students who exit the program with the diploma(s) without meeting either CGPA criteria will not be eligible for any certificates of academic achievements or prizes.
Students can repeat the theory courses any number of times within the stipulated period for diploma level to improve the overall CGPA.
Students who have overall CGPA of 6.0 or above and CGPA<7.0 in projects, which prevents them from entering the degree level, will be given one additional opportunity to improve their project grades to earn the eligibility to progress to the degree level.
Students who cannot improve their CGPA above the required cut-offs must exit the program with the diploma(s).
This rule shall be applicable to all students entering the degree level (BSc) from the May 2024 term.
For those students who completed diplomas with less than 4 standalone projects (in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms projects were included in theory courses), whatever projects were done standalone will be counted for the average CGPA of 7.0. For example, if 2 projects were done as part of the theory and 2 projects standalone, then only the grades in the two standalone projects will be used to compute the project CGPA. The projects done as part of the theory courses will not be counted.

For those who do 4 standalone projects, eligibility to enter degree level is illustrated below with some examples:

18. New Rules for Foundation & Diploma Level Completion
18.1 Foundation level checkpoints:

These conditions shall be applicable to the students admitted to the foundation level from May 2024. These are not applicable for students who have entered in Jan 2024 term or before that. But completing the foundation level in 9 terms is applicable for all.


Students will be removed from the program if they do not complete


at least 4 courses within 4 terms.
at least 6 courses within 6 terms.
the 8 foundation courses within 9 terms.

The student will be issued warnings about insufficient progress and about complying with these conditions starting from term 3.


18.2 Change in CCC at the foundation level:

This is for ALL students in the foundation level.

Currently, the CCC is calculated based on the courses passed in the last 2 terms by the students and enforced too, deciding the number of courses that students can take in a given term in the Foundation Level.

In view of the conditions imposed above leading to exit from the program if not satisfied, it was proposed that the CCC will only be a recommendation and not enforced. This will enable students to make up for term breaks and meet the proposed course completion criteria.


18.3 Increasing the maximum number of terms for completing the diploma level

The Diploma level can now be completed in a maximum of 12 terms instead of 9 terms as has been the case till now. This extension of 12 terms as the maximum limit to complete the Diploma level shall be applied for all learners, starting from the first batch, who started the Diploma Level in September 2021.

The maximum duration for the BSc and BS levels shall remain unchanged at 9 terms. The total duration permissible for the BSc and BS degrees shall also remain at 6 and 8 years, respectively.


18.4 Checkpoints in the Diploma level

These conditions below shall be applicable to the students admitted to the Diploma level from May 2024. These are not applicable for students who have entered in Jan 2024 term or before that.

To ensure continuous progress and steer students towards completing courses on time, the following intermediate checkpoints were also proposed. The student must complete

at least 3 courses and 1 project in the first 3 terms from starting the Diploma level - if not, they will be put on academic probation and given a warning.
at least 6 courses and 2 projects in the first 6 terms from starting the Diploma level - if not, they will be removed from the program.
at least 9 courses and 3 projects in the first 9 terms from starting the Diploma level - if not, they will be removed from the program.
All 12 courses and 4 projects in 12 terms from starting the Diploma level - if not, they will be removed from the program
The student will be issued sufficient alerts and warnings about these checkpoints.



19. Eligibility Criteria Prize


The Direct admission to the Diploma, where students exit with the Diploma, comprises 8

courses and 2 projects (35 credits).

Eligibility for Prizes:


1. Certificate of Merit

Awarded to students at 2 levels: completing Foundation+2 Diplomas (86 credits),

completing the BS degree (142 credits)

Criteria: CGPA between 9.00 and 9.50 at the end of Foundation+2 Diplomas or when

graduating with BS.


2. Certificate of Academic Distinction

Awarded to students at 2 levels: completing Foundation+2 Diplomas (86 credits) or

completing the BS degree (142 credits)

Criteria: All students with CGPA greater than 9.50 at the end of Foundation+2 Diplomas

or when graduating with BS.


3. Certificate of Academic Excellence

Awarded to students at 2 levels: completing Foundation+2 Diplomas (86 credits) or

completing the BS degree (142 credits)


Criteria: The students with the highest CGPA at the end of Foundation+2 Diplomas or

when graduating with BS will be identified and awarded. The actual number of students

will be decided by the Steering committee.


The students under the above three categories will be awarded a medal along with the certificate.


The following will be the process followed for identifying the students eligible for the awards:

a. The list of students completing the foundation+2 diplomas or the BS degree in a

calendar year January-December will be consolidated and considered to finalize the

prizes.

b. Certificates will be awarded for all the 3 categories (Certificate of Merit , Certificate of Academic Distinction , Certificate of Academic Excellence) with medals being given for the students for the respective category.

c. The students completing Diplomas through the Direct admission process will be

considered as a separate category and will be eligible for prizes with medals being given for the students for the respective category.


Prize Eligibility Criteria for Improvement Courses


For the prizes awarded after the diploma level, we will consider the CGPA only till the term when the student completes the two diplomas. Improvements in foundational/diploma courses done after completion of both diplomas will not be considered for the diploma-level prizes. For example, if a student had repeated a foundation/diploma course for improvement in September 2023 but had completed both diplomas in May 2023, then the CGPA secured in May 2023 will be considered for diploma-level prize. Diploma-level prizes will not be given retrospectively.


Certificate of Merit and Distinction Policy


Students eligible for a Certificate of Merit or Distinction must maintain a clean academic and disciplinary record. Any instance of academic malpractice or disciplinary violation in a student's history will result in disqualification from receiving the certificate, irrespective of academic performance.

The details in this document are subject to change and just tentative guidelines. Please check IITM's website for the rules that are currently applicable for each process.


Get a GATE score/rank and apply to IITM's MTech/MS or PhD programs (Campus program)
Writing the GATE exam opens doors to you at 100s of institutes and not just IITM. Using the GATE score, you can apply for an MTech or MS or PhD depending on what other degree you have apart from the BS degree.

You will get a stipend from the institute if you join the MTech (HTTA) /MS or PhD program.
This is our most recommended option for all students as the GATE score also enables you to apply to PSU jobs.


Check the link for more details : https://research.iitm.ac.in/


Apply for the MS program as a CFTI student if you have CGPA>= 8.0 in IITM's BS program. (Campus program)
GATE score is not required for this
You will have to go through the admission process which may involve a test and/or interview to be selected.
The program will involve at least 1 year of course work and another 1-2 years of research work.
Monthly stipend is provided by the institute.
Outcomes:
Complete MS and apply for a job.
Upgrade and convert the MS into a PhD at IITM.
Complete the MS and apply for a PhD at IITM or outside.


The Senate noted the omission of the CFTI clause and approved to include the CFTI clause in the minimum requirements for admission to MS admissions for the departments of MST and DSAI of IIT Madras


Check the link for more details : https://research.iitm.ac.in/       


Apply to the MS program as a Project staff within IITM (Campus program)
If you are appointed as a project staff in any project with faculty at IITM, you may be eligible for project admission to the MS program.
While you are project staff, you need to register for courses on campus, as approved by your project faculty.
You need to complete two approved courses at IITM with CGPA ≥ 7.5, and have obtained at least a 'C' grade in each course to be eligible to apply for admission.
You need not have a GATE score or a minimum CGPA in the IITM BS program for this mode of admission.
You have to go through the admission process as stipulated by the department, which can include a test and/or interview.
The institute does not pay you the stipend in this case, but you will be supported through the project. The payment you get from the project is fixed by the PI.
Outcomes:
Complete MS and apply for a job.
Complete the MS and apply for a PhD at IITM or outside.
Upgrade and convert the MS into a PhD at IITM.

Upgrade to the on-campus MS program
When you have completed 106 credits and CGPA >=8, you can apply in May/Nov of every year through the form floated by the POD team for the direct upgrade to MS.
If selected, you will do the BS level courses on campus in person (16 credits of course work and 12 credits of project).
Selection to do the BS level will be through a test and/or interview.
Once the BS level of 28 credits is completed on campus and hence, the requirements of the BS degree, you will be assessed, and if found suitable, you will be admitted to the MS program. Stipend will be paid by the institute as per the prevalent norms. Fees to be paid for the MS program are given on the website.

e.  Upgrade to a PG Diploma or MTech degree online after the BS


Once a student has completed 142 credits and the BS degree, they can choose to continue to study more courses. If they complete 20 more credits (3 core and 2 elective courses), students will be awarded a PG Diploma.

If they continue to do a project of 20 credits, they can earn an MTech from IIT Madras.


i.         This option to upgrade to the PGD or MTech can be exercised at any time after

       they complete 106 credits until they complete 142 credits.

ii.         The CGPA cutoff required in the BS program for applying for this upgrade is 8.00.

iii.         This option is recommended for working professionals who cannot afford to leave      

       their jobs and join a physical college for a Masters degree. We strongly

       recommend that standalone students, who have joined the BS program after std

       XII to write the GATE exam and join a college for their Masters and not take this

       Option.

 22. Apprenticeship in the BS level of IIT Madras' BS in Data Science and Applications
The program provides the students in the BS level of the program to pursue an apprenticeship with companies and research projects and earn up to 12 credits in this level. Doing an apprenticeship is optional.


Steps involved in the Apprenticeship program:

Approval for the company/research project where the student can work as an apprentice
If the student applies and is accepted by any of the companies that are preapproved by IITM for this purpose, the apprenticeship will be directly approved.

Else the student will have to submit the details of the company/organization and the Apprenticeship  committee will decide based on the details submitted.

Reporting Manager
Once the apprenticeship is approved, the student has to submit the details of the Reporting Manager in the Organization to IITM.

Logging the weekly work report
Student has to file the work log to IITM BS office every week.

Review after first 4 weeks
After 4 weeks, based on the student's performance,  the reporting manager has to confirm if they would like to continue with the student as an apprentice for the next 7 months. This confirmation letter should be submitted to the IITM BS Program's Office.

Possible exit after 4 months
After the completion of 4 months, the student or the company can choose to discontinue the apprenticeship. A letter from the company has to be submitted outlining the work done by the student and whether it was satisfactory to obtain partial credits.

After the completion of 8 months of internship
A letter from the Reporting Manager should be submitted to the IITM BS program on the company's letterhead stating the work done by the student and whether it was satisfactory.


The following will be norms with respect to pursuing an apprenticeship:

Number of courses that can be taken along while pursuing the apprenticeship
Students can pursue a maximum of 2 courses each term during the duration of the apprenticeship.

Duration of the apprenticeship that can be credited - 8 months, full time
Academic Credits
<4 months: 0 credits.
4<duration<8 months: 4 credits
8 months: 12 credits
Stipend: This is mutually agreed upon between the student and the company when finalizing the apprenticeship.
Mode of apprenticeship: Remote or On-site: This will depend on the company's policy.
Pre-placement Offer: On successful completion of the apprenticeship, companies will have the option to give a pre-placement offer to the students.
Payment of fees:
The fee for credit transfer is fixed as Rs 5000/- per credit for Apprenticeship. When  students opt to credit this at the BS level, they have to pay the credit transfer fee at the time of registration.


Please refer the link to know more about Apprenticeship: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ_ZCTw1_PzVDBJ7u-wX18KUgl-IK1POIYRvyjAYsj_A-tS99K7ARRuNVKk0tp34B1woqclNxvY_0Lc/pub
